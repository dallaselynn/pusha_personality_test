right way\nMayday, what they gon say\nComing to they hood, the Clipse and Tammy\n\n[Hook - Tammy Lucas]\nMother fucker what you here for?\nNow you wonder why I gotta the chrome four to your ear for\nSo you can hear yo (Uncle Terrar you gon let him go?)\nI don't know\nCount to a hundred wit yo eyes closed\nSoon every number is a face of a nigga that's gon die yo\nThey try to hit me but they too slow (Daddy, you gon' let him go)\nI don't know\n\n[Verse - Pusha T]\nAre you ready for the showdown?\nIt won't be pretty if I get another go down\nIn all aspects, low down\nWhen I hit him, make sure he won't see another go round\nWhat make him think he can flame wit me\nNow he hatin' life cause he tried to bang wit me\nHad to show him death weren't a thing to me\nNothin more than a mere blood stain to me\nIt's pain to see, ain't a nigga rank wit me\nBetter yet, ain't a mother fucker hangin me\nTen more on your side, what your odds gon be\nSlim to none cause they all want to run wit me\nThe nerve to ask, why terrar hold the heat?\nHopelessly, they try to steal my deal just to roast the feat\nIf I'm the one from being followed\nHave my girl double back, mack eleven make m holla\nAnd it's just that easy, one trigger one sque-eze\nAnd he droppin' to his kne-es; damn right, lit him up\nGive a fuck about him let the paramedic get him up\nI had to muffle his heart beat\nHit everything but the baby in the back in the car seat\nHad to show his partner talk cheap\nAnd I'ma draw heat, if a nigga think I wanna walk for heat\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge - Tammy Lucas] (4x)\nThink about the things you did\nAnd the things you didn't as a kid\nNo time to stop cause I'm gonna end your life\n\n[Tammy Lucas - repeat to Hook]\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la\n\n[Hook]"},
