I feel \u2018em hating me now, it\u2019s like\nHeavy, the head that wears the crown, it\u2019s like\nHeaven is shared, I walk in the clouds\nI\u2019m so much better, yet we still trapped in the crowd\nAnd we raise the bar on you when we capture the sound\nAnd make \u2018em raise arms on you like we black and we proud\n(Woo!)
